# Build smart contract

This educational journey laid a strong groundwork in Ethereum smart contract development, deployment, and interaction. 

Practical exercises and GitHub updates provided hands-on experience and resulted in a demonstrative code portfolio. 

I gained expertise in creating ERC20 tokens, managing hashed messages on the blockchain, and automating smart contract interactions using ethers.js. 

Additionally, I investigated zkSync and paymasters for transaction fee handling and token balance management.
